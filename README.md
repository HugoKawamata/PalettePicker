# PalettePicker
A react web app for generating colour palettes and exporting them as sass files.

## SCSS Export
Once you have generated a palette you're happy with, you can copy your palette to the clipboard in `.scss` format.

## Website Preview
There is a basic website template which you can colour by clicking the DOM elements. Elements will be coloured according to the active colour. You can change your active colour to one of your palette colours by clicking on the coloured dot in the palette.
